# Currency-converter

This is a front-end web application designed to convert currency values between different global currencies in real time. It includes a visually appealing homepage with a sticky internship banner, a collapsible sidebar for navigation, and a functional currency converter built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

The app is user-friendly, responsive across device sizes, and leverages a live currency exchange API to perform accurate conversions. It can serve as a mini-project for learning front-end development concepts such as layout, responsiveness, API integration, and component organization.
